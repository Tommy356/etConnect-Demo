			<Abstract type="html">The EINetConnectionInStreamDelegate protocol allows the monitoring of network transport
layer. You&apos;ll use this to get notifications on the network transport progress while calling remote
methods that generate a large amount of data (i.e. transferring images or sound files).
Typically you would set a delegate before calling such a method on the client side and implement
the connectionDidRead: method to get notified about the data to be transmitted.
It is NOT recommended to generally set a delegate, as this methods adds additional overhead
to the time-critical network tranbsport.</Abstract>

			<Abstract type="html">Passes up a range where length holds the number of bytes expected, and location
